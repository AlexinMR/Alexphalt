# Alexphalt
Made in the Processing language, this simple driving game asks the player to dodge and weave through traffic in order to survive and reach a score threshhold. Cars will randomly spawn off-screen and drive on-screen from one of the 5 lanes. The player is free to move in any direction, but cannot go out of bounds.

Includes collision detection, animations, multiple difficulty settings, win/lose conditions, scoreboard, and infinite mode.

### Goal: 
   Dodge as many cars as possible; successfully passing a car gains 1 point; gain 50 points to win.
### Keyboard controls: 
   Use ‘1’, ‘2’, ’3’ to choose your level (this can be modified while playing);
   Use ‘4’ to switch to “Infinite Mode” (Speed gradually increases over time);
   Use ‘5’ to pause;

#### Score and level are displayed in the top right corner.

### Lose condition:
If you crash into another car, you lose; the high scores for that session and a restart button will both be displayed.
